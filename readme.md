# CoreML - Boston Pricer

I am starting a series of posts that I hope can be seen as an "open notebook" of my experimentation and learning with Apple technology. One that comes to mind is CoreML, a new framework that makes running various machine learning and statistical models on macOS and iOS natively supported. The idea is that the framework helps data scientists and developers bridge the gap between them by integrating trained models into our apps. Sounds cool, don't you think? Ready... Let's go!
